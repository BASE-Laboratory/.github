# BASE Laboratory: Beamlines for Autonomous Science and Engineering

> **"Teaching Beamlines to Think"**

We are a research group based at the **University of Greenwich** and the **Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL)**. We move materials characterization from passive observation to intelligent, active searching.

### 🔬 Our Mission
We are building **"Self-Driving Microscopes"**—autonomous platforms that use AI to pilot synchrotron beamlines in real-time. We target the stochastic, fleeting precursors to battery failure that standard deterministic tests miss.

### 🛠️ Core Research Pillars
* **The Experimental Hub (RAL/Harwell):** Deploying autonomous control systems live on beamlines (Diamond Light Source, ISIS).
* **The Computational Hub (Greenwich):** Developing Graph Neural Networks, Digital Twins, and AI Agents.
* **The Application:** Multimodal characterization (XCT, XRD, XRF) of Li-ion, Na-ion, and Solid-State batteries.

### 📦 Key Projects & Software
| Project | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Faraday Engine** | National data infrastructure hardwiring UK Exascale computing to synchrotron beamlines. | 🚧 In Development |
| **OpenImpala** | Open-source solver turning 3D tomographic data into electrochemical insight. | 🟢 Active |
| **Heuristic Operando** | Framework for entropy-scaled measurement efficiency (ESME) in autonomous labs. | 📜 arXiv:2601.00851 |

### 📢 We Are Hiring!
We are currently looking for our founding **PhD Student** to design the **Predictive Engine** for the Self-Driving Microscope.
* **Role:** Design the brain that teaches the microscope how to think.
* **Location:** Greenwich (London) & RAL (Harwell).
* **Funding:** Fully funded 4-year studentship.
